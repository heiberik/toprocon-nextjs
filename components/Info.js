                    Interesting topics. Provocative topics. Nich√© topics.
                    Every topic is welcomed and a key factor in making this
                    site a place where thoughts can be shared and steadfast
                    opinions perhaps can be loosened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To strive towards these goals we must all adhere to a
                    few basic rules when making a new topic. Please read them
                    carefully.
                </p>
